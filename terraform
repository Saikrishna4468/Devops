What is Terrafrom ?
  Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows users to define, provision, and manage infrastructure (such as servers, databases, and networks) using declarative configuration files. 
  Terraform supports multiple cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, GCP) and on-premise data centers, enabling consistent infrastructure management across environments.
