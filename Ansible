What is Ansible:
  Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, and task automation. It is designed to simplify IT tasks by automating repetitive, complex operations. 
  Ansible is agentless, meaning it doesn’t require any special software to be installed on the managed systems—it communicates using SSH (for Linux) or WinRM (for Windows).
What is PlayBook ?
  A Playbook in Ansible is a file written in YAML that contains a series of instructions or tasks for Ansible to execute on managed nodes (servers).
What is Ansible Adhoc ?
  if we want to execute a couple of commands in ansible nodes, instead of going through ansible playbook, we can use ansible adhoc commands.


1. install Ansible in master -- > sudo apt install ansible
2. to check -- > ansible --version
3. generate key in master node -- > ssh-keygen
4. copy public key in master that is in particular path
5. go to child node again do "ssh-keygen" in that, go to (vi authoriged keys) paste the public key in that.
6. then we access the child node from master node.
7. you can test it by ssh <private address of child node> --> you can access it.
8. logout

we need to save child node private ip address in inventory file which is in master node

execute this command in aster node
    ansible -i inventory all -m "shell" -a "touch devops"
    --> -m indicates the module, -a indicates the command we exxecute.
    -->  this coomand creates the devops file in child nodes i.e., ip address in invetory file
    -->  shell indicates the, we executes the shell commands

we can executes various commands visit ansible documentations  --> https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/copy_module.html#copy-module
