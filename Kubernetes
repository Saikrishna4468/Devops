Disadvantages of Docker
1. Docker is a single host.
  ex: i have a host on top of it i install docker and i run 100 containers on it, among all of it 1 st container takes lots of memory,
      compared to last container, so that the kernel will kill last container.one of the container will die because of other containers, this is because of single host
2. Not having a Auto healing feature
3. Docker does not support Enterprise level support

These Disadvantages will overcome by Kubernetes
